        <p>This project is a project that I made to fulfill the final assignment for the Algorithms and Structures course
            Data in semester 3. This project
            is a book and student data storage system using the Stack, Queue data structure algorithm
            and using hashing to secure student account password data.
            Local storage uses a txt file which will be generated and edited automatically via
            user input</p>

        <p>This project is a project that I created to fulfill the final assignment for the Oriented Programming course
            Objects in semester 4
            Data. This project is a turnbase multiplayer game where players are linked together
            a database.
            Game and player data is saved every time there is a change (number of chips, value and card symbols, etc.).
            The game will be finished if one of the players folds or beats the player in the last turn
            (Showdown), where the combination of card values for each player will be calculated and compared</p>
